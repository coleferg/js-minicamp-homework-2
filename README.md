# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`
	        'for' loops are a way to have code repeat itself until you tell it to stop. If you don't tell it to stop then it'll keep going forever and crash the program.
	
	* `&&` 
	    '&&' is a command that wants two statements together to be true for the whole statement to be true. Other wise the statement is false.
	
	`||` 
	    '||' is a command that will evaluate to true if at least one statement of the two your comparing is correct.
	
	`!`
	    '!' is a way of defining a boolean as the opposite of what it is. It is a way representing what a variable or statement isn't.
	
	* Arrays
	    Arrays are objects that have multiple variables or objects within them inside of '[]' brackets.
	
	* Git
	    Git is a way of editing, submitting, and downloading code to a database where other people can edit or check out what you have done.
	
	* GitHub
	    GitHub is a website that hosts Git servers for you to contribute or to upload onto.
